# 🧹 Data Cleaning (Power Query)

The dataset was cleaned using **Excel Power Query**, which allowed automated and repeatable data transformation.

### Key Data Cleaning Steps

✔ Imported CSV dataset using Power Query
✔ Promoted column headers
✔ Corrected data types for numerical columns
✔ Trimmed and cleaned text values
✔ Removed blank rows
✔ Removed duplicate records
✔ Renamed columns for clarity
✔ Reordered columns for logical structure

### Feature Engineering

Additional performance metrics were created using **custom columns**:

| Metric                  | Description                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| overall_offensive_score | Combined attacking contributions   |
| overall_defense_score   | Defensive contribution calculation |
| overall_performance     | Final player performance metric    |

These transformations were applied in **Power Query Applied Steps**, ensuring the workflow is reproducible.

# 📈 Data Analysis Using Pivot Tables

After cleaning the dataset, **PivotTables were used to summarize and analyze performance metrics**.

### Pivot Table Analysis Included

📌 Top attacking players
📌 Best blockers
📌 Top servers
📌 Defensive performance leaders
📌 Overall player performance ranking
📌 Setter performance analysis

PivotTables allowed quick aggregation of metrics such as:

* **Sum of attack score**
* **Sum of block score**
* **Sum of serve score**
* **Overall performance metrics**

# 📊 Pivot Charts & Visualization

PivotCharts were created from PivotTables to visualize player performance.

### Charts Included

📊 Top 5 Attackers – Pie Chart
📊 Top 5 Blockers – Bar Chart
📊 Top 5 Servers – Horizontal Bar Chart
📊 Top Defensive Players – Column Chart
📊 Top Overall Performers – Ranking Chart
🌍 Country Performance Map – Geographic Visualization

These visualizations allow quick identification of **top players and country-level performance patterns**.

# 🎛 Interactive Dashboard Features

The dashboard includes **interactive filtering capabilities** using slicers.

### Dashboard Filters

🔹 Player Position
🔹 Player Country

These slicers dynamically update all charts and metrics in the dashboard.

This enables users to explore:

* Performance by **player role**
* Performance by **country**
* Top players across different skill categories

---

# 🔍 Key Insights

Some insights observed from the dashboard:

* **Outside hitters dominate attacking metrics**
* **Middle blockers lead blocking statistics**
* Certain countries show consistently strong performance across multiple categories
* Top performers vary significantly based on position roles
